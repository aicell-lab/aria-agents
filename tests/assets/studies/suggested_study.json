This may include changes in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism, similar to findings in other osteosarcoma cell lines.","experiment_workflow":"1. Culture U2OS cells and treat them with a chemotherapeutic agent such as methotrexate. \n2. Extract metabolites from both treated and untreated U2OS cells.\n3. Perform metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy to identify and quantify metabolites.\n4. Analyze the data to identify metabolic pathways that are differentially regulated in response to treatment.\n5. Compare the results with existing data on osteosarcoma cell lines to identify common and unique metabolic responses [2][3].","experiment_hypothesis":"Chemotherapeutic stress induces specific alterations in the metabolomic profile of U2OS cells, which can be characterized by changes in key metabolic pathways such as amino acid, fatty acid, and energy metabolism.","experiment_reasoning":"Given the lack of specific studies on U2OS cells, this experiment aims to fill the gap by applying metabolomics to understand how these cells respond to chemotherapeutic stress. Previous studies have shown that osteosarcoma cell lines exhibit changes in specific metabolic pathways under similar conditions [2][3]. This study will help in identifying potential metabolic targets for therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma.","references":["[2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313215/","[3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5503552/"]}
